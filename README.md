#### Projet Niryo One
#### ESIREM 4A program 

## Introduction : 

This project had been done during my engineering program at ESIREM ( school of materials research and engineering ) at Le Creusot campus - France. 

### Objectives: 

The project involves exploring Niryo One 6-axis collaborative robot arm 

Then in a first part know how to handle it by its already built software and in a second part manipulate it by ROS.


## Exploring the robot: 

Niryo One robot is a collaborative and open source 6-axis robot created by Niryo society society in france for: 

Higher education 

Vocational training 

R&D laboratories 

Its use is particularly adapted to study robotics and programming in the context of the industry 4.0.
