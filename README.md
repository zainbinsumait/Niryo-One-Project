# Niryo-One-Project

#### Projet Niryo One (ESIREM 4A program)


## Introduction : 

This project had been done during my engineering program at ESIREM ( school of materials research and engineering ) at Le Creusot campus - France. 

### Objectives: 

The project involves exploring Niryo One 6-axis collaborative robot arm 

Then in a first part know how to handle it by its already built software and in a second part manipulate it by ROS.


## Exploring the robot: 

Niryo One robot is a collaborative and open source 6-axis robot created by Niryo society society in france for: 

Higher education 

Vocational training 

R&D laboratories 

Its use is particularly adapted to study robotics and programming in the context of the industry 4.0.





## Using guide 

In order to know how to deal with the robot, it's necessary to know this buttons and I/O :

Steps to start using the Robot with the software Niryo One Studio:
* Connect the robot to a Power Supply, which came with, connect also the built if you want to use it.
* Turn on the robot by the
